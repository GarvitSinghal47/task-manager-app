We shall practice atomic design model with properly arranging and aligning our components to atoms, molecules and organisms. Moreover, we can focus and emphasize on practicing writing clean code.

### What shall we have as features

We shall create task management page where user is able to create task, edit task and delete task. We shall use redux for state management and Material UI for styles.
